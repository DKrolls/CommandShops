<b>Commands:</b></span> [required] &lt;optional&gt;<br>
<ul>
<li><b>/shop</b><ul>
<li>Displays a list of player commands<br>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>/shop<b> select</b><ul>

<li>Select a cuboid area for a shop to occupy.  Used in conjunction with both the <b>create</b> and <b>move</b> commands.  Using the <b>select</b> command a second time will cancel the selection process.<br>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>/shop <b>create [shop name]</b><ul>
<li>Creates a shop of the default sized (specified in the configuration file) at your location.</li>

<li>If used after the <b>select</b> command - assuming the player didn’t cancel the selection process, possess enough money to create a shop (also specified in the configuration file) and the selection is smaller than the maximum allowed area (again, specified in the configuration file) - a shop will be created that fills the specified area.</li>
<li>Remember, shops are created in a 3D space - selecting two blocks on the floor will likely result in the creation of a shop that is a single block tall, which isn’t particularly useful to anyone.<br>
