Local Shops
======

A cuboid shop plugin for Bukkit
http://www.github.com/Bukkit

Implemented
-----------

* Shop Class
* Read shop data files and build hash table
* Add shops to cuboid tree
* check if user is in shop on move (fixed!)
* file output
* /shop create
* /shop list
* /shop list buy|sell
* /shop sell
* /shop add
* created items.txt with unique names for each item and data combinaiton

Still TODO
-----------

* add default world to files that don't start with them (converting old format)
* Build user commands 
- /shop buy 
- /shop remove
- /shop set (buy|sell|stacksize)
- /shop destroy
* hook into iConomy
* hook into Permissions

Eventual Goal:
-----------
* Display shop inventories in chests and purchase through inventory screen
